# Python-Fast-Raytracer

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/rafael-fuente/Python-Fast-Raytracer)](https://repl.it/github/rafael-fuente/Python-Fast-Raytracer)

A basic raytracer that exploits numpy arrays and functions to work fast.
The code is written keeping as much readability as possible. 

You'll need to install two packages.

1. Pillow is a fork of the PIL package.  It provides the Image module for this application.
to install it run the following.
```
pip install pillow
```
2. Numpy is a scientific package that helps with mathematical functions.
```
pip install numpy
```
